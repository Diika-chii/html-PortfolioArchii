                    <h1>NELSON's HOUSE</h1>
                    <p>
                      Nelson's House is a thoughtfully designed single-story family residence that serves as both a primary dwelling and a 
                        seasonal retreat, nestled in a remote Igbo village. Spanning 252 square meters (18.5m by 17.1m), the structure is 
                        carefully planned to maximize space within a compact plot while respecting local cultural and communal land tenure 
                        constraints. The layout includes two bedrooms, a main lounge, a kitchen with a pantry, a dining area, and a winery 
                        on the ground floor. The first floor accommodates four additional bedrooms, a family lounge, an open void that 
                        enhances spatial connectivity, and a sit-out area that fosters a seamless indoor-outdoor experience.
                        The design process was deeply influenced by the village’s communal setting, where land ownership and extended 
                        family expectations played a crucial role in shaping the final outcome. As construction progressed, design 
                        modifications were necessary to align with cultural preferences, demonstrating how architecture is not just a 
                  
                        response to physical constraints but also a negotiation with social and familial dynamics.
                        Beyond its functional layout, Nelson’s Home integrates traditional Igbo architectural elements with a modern 
                        approach, ensuring that the structure is both contextually relevant and adaptable to contemporary living. The 
                        project reflects an understanding of spatial hierarchy, cultural symbolism, and practical needs, creating a 
                        harmonious balance between heritage and modernity.<br><br>

                          Nelson’s Home is more than a residence; it is a case study in spatial adaptation, cultural sensitivity, and 
                          functional design, demonstrating how architecture can both navigate tradition and embrace evolving lifestyles.
